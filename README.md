This project is a **Java-based** School Management System designed to streamline and simplify the management of student records, academic performance, and administrative tasks. It aims to improve communication between students, teachers, and parents, making it easier for school administrators to manage student data and generate report cards efficiently.

## Features

- **Admin Login**: A secure login system for administrators to access the platform.
- **Student Management**: Administrators can create, update, or delete student records.
- **Report Card Generation**: Automated generation of report cards with an integrated grading system.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Java Swing, offering an intuitive GUI for all users.

## Project Modules

1. **Admin's Registration**: Secure registration system for school administrators.
2. **Student Module**: Allows the admin to add, edit, delete, or view student details.
3. **Report Card Module**: Enables easy generation and management of student report cards.

## Technologies Used

- **Java (Swing Framework)**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **MySQL (XAMPP)**: For database management to store student and report card data.
- **NetBeans IDE**: Used for development and debugging.
  
## How it Works

1. **Login Page**: The admin logs in using a secure username and password. Upon successful login, they are directed to the admin dashboard.
   
2. **Dashboard**: The dashboard provides access to two modules:

   - **Report Card Generation**: Create detailed report cards with an automated grading system.

3. **Student Module**: 
   - Add new students with essential details (ID, name, parent's name, class, etc.).
   - Edit existing student records.
   - Delete student records.
   - Search for students and view detailed records.

4. **Report Card Module**: 
   - Generate report cards based on student performance.
   - Automated grading system for ease of report creation.
